# IRIS-Insight

**Cataract Detection Using Deep Learning**

Cataracts are a leading cause of blindness worldwide, posing a significant global health challenge. IRIS-Insight is an innovative eye disease detection system that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques to analyze retinal fundus images. By automating the classification of fundus images into two categories—normal and cataractous—this project aims to revolutionize cataract detection and enhance accessibility to screening services, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Features
- **Automated Cataract Detection**: Classifies retinal fundus images as normal or cataractous with high accuracy.
- **Early Diagnosis**: Facilitates timely interventions to prevent long-term visual impairment.
- **Accessibility**: Brings advanced diagnostic tools to under-resourced regions.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces reliance on specialized healthcare professionals for initial screening.
- **Objective Analysis**: Minimizes subjective biases in diagnosis by employing AI-driven methods.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop an AI-powered system for analyzing retinal fundus images.
2. Improve early detection rates of cataracts through automated screening.
3. Enhance the accessibility and affordability of diagnostic tools for eye care.
4. Support healthcare professionals with an efficient and reliable diagnostic assistant.

## Methodology
IRIS utilizes deep learning algorithms to analyze fundus images, following these key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of retinal fundus images categorized as normal or cataractous.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize, resize, and augment images to improve model performance.
3. **Model Development**: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
4. **Validation**: Evaluate the model using test datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5. **Deployment**: Implement the system for real-world cataract detection.

## Benefits
- **Improved Eye Health Outcomes**: Early detection leads to better treatment options and reduced risk of blindness.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to various settings, from small clinics to large hospitals.
- **Efficiency**: Saves patients' and healthcare providers' time and resources.



## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV, Pillow
- **Dataset**: Publicly available retinal fundus image datasets
